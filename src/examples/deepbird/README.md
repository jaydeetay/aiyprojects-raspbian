# A Bird Detector

Building on the provided bird classifier to automatically photograph
and upload pictures of birds.

First version is just me messing about with the APIs.

## Setting up your development environment.

It's highly recommended to not develop on the Pi Zero itself, which
is a little underpowered for the task. Instead, ssh into it from another
machine for your everyday commandline work. For example, if you haven't changed the defaults:
    ssh pi@raspberrypi

(password `raspberry`).
